<h2 class="section">Coffee Quality Analysis</h2>
<h3 class="name">Brandon Luong</h3>

</div>
<div id = "intro"> Coffee is arguably one of the most popular drinks in the entire world. This drink is enjoyed by many different demographics of people ranging in all ages since there are so many kinds of styles, and brews of coffee. Because of its popularity, coffee beans are also produced world wide, and each of these places produce different quality beans. The goal of this project is to examine which characteristics contribute to a coffee's quality.

<!-- <h3>Plot with 0 Key and 2 Values:</h3> -->
<div id = "vis1_intro"> Firstly, coffee has different kinds of roasts which impacts the flavor of the drink. We will analyze the relationship between the rating and price for each type of roast.

<div id = "vis2_intro"> We will next take a look at the average prices per roast of coffee that each country processes. Note that these countries are not the origins of the beans, rather where they are processed to bring out the best flavors through different techniques.

More specifically, which countrie contain the most coffee roasters, which process the coffee?
